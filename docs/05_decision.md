# Decision


## D001 - Execution consumes promoted decisions only

Date: 2026-04-25

### Context

The trading platform needs `trading-execution` to have a clear owner boundary before implementation begins.

### Decision

Execution must not independently choose strategies, train models, or bypass manager-controlled promotion.

### Rationale

A narrow component boundary prevents hidden coupling and keeps cross-repository work reviewable.

### Consequences

- Implementation work must stay inside the accepted component role.
- Shared names and contracts must route through `trading-main`.
- Generated outputs and secrets must stay out of Git.


## D002 - Broker/exchange operations are safety-sensitive

Date: 2026-04-25

### Context

The trading platform needs `trading-execution` to have a clear owner boundary before implementation begins.

### Decision

Live order placement and account-affecting actions require explicit mode boundaries, safeguards, and evidence.

### Rationale

A narrow component boundary prevents hidden coupling and keeps cross-repository work reviewable.

### Consequences

- Implementation work must stay inside the accepted component role.
- Shared names and contracts must route through `trading-main`.
- Generated outputs and secrets must stay out of Git.


## D003 - Credentials stay outside the repository

Date: 2026-04-25

### Context

The trading platform needs `trading-execution` to have a clear owner boundary before implementation begins.

### Decision

Broker/exchange credentials and tokens must be stored as secret aliases or external secret material, never in Git.

### Rationale

A narrow component boundary prevents hidden coupling and keeps cross-repository work reviewable.

### Consequences

- Implementation work must stay inside the accepted component role.
- Shared names and contracts must route through `trading-main`.
- Generated outputs and secrets must stay out of Git.


## D002 - Calendar discovery belongs to execution

Future macro release calendars are realtime acquisition triggers, not historical data payloads. `trading-execution` owns `calendar_discovery` code for discovering official release-calendar URLs, fetching official pages/feeds, and producing release-event rows for scheduling. `trading-data` remains focused on historical data retrieval and cleaning.
